abstract = {Every random number generator has its advantages and deficiencies. There are no “safe” generators. The practitioner's problem is how to decide which random number generator will suit his needs best. In this paper, we will discuss criteria for good random number generators: theoretical support, empirical evidence and practical aspects. We will study several recent algorithms that perform better than most generators in actual use. We will compare the different methods and supply numerical results as well as selected pointers and links to important literature and other sources. Additional information on random number generation, including the code of most algorithms discussed in this paper is available from our web-server under the address http://random.mat.sbg.ac.at/}

In the course of discussing a monte carlo solution we also present a new form of variance reduction, called Hierarchical sampling and give a number of elaborations shows that it may be an efficient new technique for a wide variety of monte carlo procedures. The resulting rendering algorithm extends the range of optical phenomena which can be effectively simulated.},

abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},
